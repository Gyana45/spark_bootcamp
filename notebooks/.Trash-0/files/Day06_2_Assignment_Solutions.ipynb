1. Using the orders and products datasets, find the **top 2 most profitable products in each state**, where profit is defined as `(unit_price − cost_price) * quantity`. Consider only delivered orders. Return state, product_id, total profit, and rank within the state.

2. For each customer, identify their **most recent order** and calculate the **difference between that order’s unit price and the average unit price of all products purchased by that customer**. Return customer_id, order_id, order_date, unit_price, and the price difference.

3.Using orders and products data, determine for each year the **product that contributed the highest percentage of total yearly revenue**. Return order_year, product_id, product_revenue, total_year_revenue, and revenue_percentage.

4. Using the orders and products datasets, calculate for each state the running cumulative revenue over time, ordered by order_date, and return state, order_date, order_id, order_value, and cumulative revenue.

5.For each product, find the first and last order date along with the total revenue generated between those dates, considering only non cancelled orders.

6. Identify customers whose latest order value is greater than their previous order value, and return customer_id, order_id, order_date, previous_order_value, and latest_order_value.

7.Using orders and products data, rank products within each year based on total profit, and return only the top 3 products per year.

8.For each state and order_status combination, calculate the percentage contribution of that combination to the total revenue of that state, and return state, order_status, revenue, and revenue_percentage.

9.For each customer, calculate the moving average of order value over their last 3 orders, ordered by order_date, and return customer_id, order_id, order_date, order_value, and moving_average.

10.Using orders and products datasets, find products whose average selling price is consistently higher than cost price across all years, and return product_id, average_unit_price, average_cost_price, and price_difference.
